# Interpreting Sign Language using Neural Networks

[American Sign Language/ASL](https://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/american-sign-language) is a primary means of communication for deaf, hard of hearing and hearing nonverbal children who are nonverbal due to conditions such as down syndrome, autism and other speech disorders. Deaf students are considered as a linguistic minority and I'm hoping with this project to promote awareness and acceptance of the language among others. 

Majority of general population is unable to communicate in sign language and the aim of this project is to interprete signs from ASL into English alphabets using neural networks.
